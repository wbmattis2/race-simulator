# Race Simulator  

Car race simulation developed by Benny Mattis to specifications provided in a Codecademy project  

## How to Use  

Compile and run race_sim.c, then read the output to see how the race turns out.  

## Features

### Randomness  

The outcome of the race will be determined in part by a random number generator, so you never know who will win!  

### Pointers  

This program utilizes some pointers to mitigate memory usage; this illustrates one of the advantages of C for low-level programming.
